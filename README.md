  <p class="subtitle">Number Sense</p>
  
  <p id="number-sense">Individuals are called upon every day to use their ability to make quick mental calculations to make decisions. The development of such abilities should be an integral part of the math curriculum. Concepts covered include, but are not limited to: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, proportions, and use of mathematic notation.

Students will be given a 10-minute, fill-in-the-blank test which they must complete without doing calculations on paper or on a calculator. Erasures and mark-outs are not permitted. <br>

  <p class="subtitle">Calculator Applications</p>
  
  <p id="calculator-applications"> The calculator applications contest is designed to stimulate the development of mathematical and calculator skills for students in grade 6,7 and 8. Goals are both intellectual and practical: developing mathematical reasoning and knowledge and requiring the application of problem-solving skills toward realistic problems. Students will take a test containing 80 problems in 30 minutes. The contest consists of problems which may include calculations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, roots, and powers. It also includes straight-forward calculation problems, and simple geometric and stated problems similar to those found in recently adopted textbooks.<br>

   <p class="subtitle">General Mathematics</p>
  
  <p id="math"> Students begin taking math in elementary school and continue taking it in high school. Learning to complete math problems quickly is a valuable skill in all facets of life including engineering, accounting, completing a tax return and even grocery shopping. This contest includes problems covering, but not limited to: numeration systems, arithmetic operations involving whole numbers, integers, fractions, decimals, exponents, order of operations, probability, statistics, number theory, simple interest, measurements and conversions. Geometry and algebra problems may be included as appropriate for the grade level. <br>

  <p class="subtitle">Science</p>
  
  <p id="science"> The contest was designed to test not only memory but the
    ability to critically think about science and scientific processes 
    and concepts. Such concepts include, but are not limited to: matter
    and energy, equilibrium, force and motion, physical and chemical 
    properties, the relationship between organisms and the environment, 
    the components of our solar system, the composition of matter and 
    genetics. The contest will build upon the vast body of changing and 
    increasing knowledge described by physical, mathematical, and 
    conceptual models. <br>
